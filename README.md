1. Clean Up Input Image
2. Clean Up Storage Images - Jamie
3. Try and Match Input Image to a Storage Image


It will be effectively template matching, like the Where's Wally project. Think about your similarity measures and issues like rotation and scaling. AÂ snapshot from the phone is unlikely to be perfectly aligned and scaled to match the inventory image. This will add complexity that would be applicable in other similar applications.
